# Mono rt2 prerelease

If you came in here after reading the `mono_rt2` flag in your fxmanifest, then you might not want to use it at this time. In short: only use these resources in testing environments as it's not fully released and supported yet.

The mono rt2 environment is currently in prerelease, crashes and bugs are to be expected, and the runtime may be prone to deactivation after the given dates. Using it in production is highly discouraged and no support nor guarantees are given.

Want to start developing and testing this new environment, then [start right here](README.md). If you encounter any technical issues then create your Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE or repro) and create an issue on [FiveM GitHub](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem/issues) or contact thorium directly. [Stack Overflow has a nice help page](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) on how to make an MRE, thank you for using it.
